## <center> <i> Second SJAM Mathematical Olympiad </i> </center>
#### <center> Dec. 21, 2020, 12:00AM – Jan. 17, 2021, 11:59PM </center>

#### Links:
 - [**Sign-Up**](https://forms.gle/VrC7EFbLhy2YMEvk7)
 - [**Problem Set**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
 - [**Solution Submissions**](https://forms.gle/RXbA8CeKqibeRyGD7)

#### Basic information:
 - *Number of intelligent beings per team:* 3 or fewer (meaning you can have additional members on your team if they are extremely stupid, e.g., your dog/cat/~~siblings~~)
 - Age restriction: NONE
 - *Knowledge NOT required to solve the problems:* proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, proof that P=NP, proof of Goldbach’s conjecture, calculus, …

#### Instructions:
1. *Cheating:* No help from human beings outside your team is allowed. This means no whining to your mommy/daddy, no posting on discussion forums, etc. Exception: You’re allowed to use Wikipedia. (And other existing online sources too, although I doubt their credibility.)
2. *Registration:* Click on the sign-up link above to sign your team up for the Olympiad.
    - A cool team name will be required during registration.
    - The grade level of the most aged member of your team will be required. This is to determine awards for different age groups
        - Babies: < Gr. 9
        - Junior Level: Gr. 9/10
        - Senior Level: Gr. 11/12 (including Cégep Year 1)
        - Old People: > Gr. 12 (e.g., 5th year, Cégep Year 2)
    - Note that members can be from different schools, though each team can only represent one school. The school your team represents must be attended by at least one team member.
3. *Problems:* Click on the link at the top of this page to access your problem, in case you missed the giant icon that’s impossible not to see.
    - Mark breakdown: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12
    - The problem difficulty is weakly positively correlated with the number of points it is out of
4. *Solution write-up and submission:*
    - Scroll up to access the submission link. Submissions will trivially be electronic. Allowed formats are PDF, documents, and images. Both handwriting the solutions and typing the solutions are accepted.
    - A complete and correct solution is required for full marks on a problem.
5. *Scoring:* Your mark will be of the form of a + bi (a, b are real numbers and i satisfies i2 = -1), which is determined as follows:
    - a (0 ≤ a ≤ \\( \sum_{k=1}^{12}\, k \\)) will be based on the mathematical rigor, completeness, and clarity of your solutions ~~and the coolness of your team name~~
        - If your solution matches one of the official solutions, we’ll have a definitely legitimate marking scheme.
        - Otherwise, we’ll mark your solution like how English teachers mark your essays (i.e., assign a random mark) roughly according to the following rules:
            1. ~100% of the full marks for a complete and correct solution.
            2. ~85% of the full marks for a solution with a minor flaw.
            3. ~50% of the full marks for a solution with a major flaw.
            4. ~30% of the full marks for significant progress.
            5. ~15% of the full marks for minor progress.
        - <i><ins>Therefore, even if you don’t solve a problem, still submit any interesting observations you noted--you may get part marks!</ins></i>
    - b = 0 if you didn’t cheat, and b satisfies \\( (b^2 - 1)/(b - 1) = 2 \\) if you did cheat.
6. *Awards:*
    - Overall Gold/Silver/Bronze (awarded to the top 3 teams)
    - Overall Honorable Mentions (awarded to the teams ranked 4th to 6th)
    - Division-based Gold/Silver/Bronze (awarded to the top 3 teams in each age division)
    - School-based Gold/Silver/Bronze (awarded to the top 3 teams from each participating school)
    - Best Team Name Award
    - Nicest-Looking Typed Solutions Award (awarded to those who use either LaTeX with Computer Modern font or MS Word with Comic Sans font to typeset their solutions)
    - Neatest Handwriting Award
    - Best Submission Award (for each of the twelve problems)
    - From SJAM Award (awarded to every team that contains at least one student from SJAM)
    - From WCI Award (awarded to every team that contains at least one student from WCI)
7. *Nutritional Awards:* Tim Hortons electronic gift card with the monetary values corresponding to the awards, as described in the following table:
