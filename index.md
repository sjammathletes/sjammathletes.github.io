Hi everyone! Welcome to Mathletes 2020-2021!

Obviously, our club is going to look very different than usual this year. Although we cannot come together to do math in person, we still hope to make Mathletes meaningful even if it is only online. Here is our current plan for the 2020-2021 school year:

1. We will be posting weekly problem sets every Friday at 2:40 pm.
2. Each problem set will consist of 5 multiple choice questions and 3 word problems.
3. In order to track attendance for club credit, each problem set must be submitted within a week of being posted.
4. Your solutions do not have to be correct or fully complete. As long as we can see that you spent time and effort on the problems, you will be rewarded.
5. An answer key will be posted after each problem set is due. If you would like, our execs are also offering to give personal feedback on your solutions.

Our first problem set will be released this Friday. Please note that our plan is not fixed; we will let you know of any changes if they occur. But for now, stay safe, have fun, and keep doing math!

Sincerely,
The 2020-2021 Mathletes Executive Team
