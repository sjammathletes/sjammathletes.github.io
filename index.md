tl;dr: Second SJAM Mathematics Olympiad will be running starting next week and lasting for a month. Students participate in teams of up to 3 and submissions are electronic through our website (<ins style="color:blue;">[https://sjammathletes.github.io/](https://sjammathletes.github.io/)</ins>) which will soon be updated with more information and the problems posted.

Hey Mathletes!

Because of the current state of the world, we'll all be stuck at home so Winter Break will be very boring... or, will it? \*vsauce music intensifies\*

Let SJAM Mathletes announce that we will be organizing the Second SJAM Mathematics Olympiad (SJAMMO2)! It will run from the first week of Winter Break to the end of the 2nd week after Winter Break so that people c̶a̶n̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶r̶t̶u̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶b̶y̶ ̶m̶a̶t̶h̶ have something to enjoy during Winter Break!

For those of you who don't know, we started organizing the SJAMMO in school year 2018-2019 to provide SJAM students an opportunity to experience solving fun math challenges with emotional support from teammates/friends and snacks. And also to make history by giving winners Twice the Deal pizzas as awards.

Unfortunately, 2020 is a special year, and we had to cancel the in-person SJAMMO2 for the school year 2019-2020. However, after p̶r̶o̶c̶r̶a̶s̶t̶i̶n̶a̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ dedicated hard work by us Mathletes execs, we are now finally ready to present SJAMMO2 in an online format!

More detailed information will come soon. Meanwhile, here is some basic information:
- All information (rules, instructions, awards) and registration/submission will be through our e̶x̶t̶r̶e̶m̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶d̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶website (<ins style="color:blue;">[https://sjammathletes.github.io/](https://sjammathletes.github.io/)</ins>)
- As in the past, students will participate in teams of up to 3.
- Different from the past, we're accepting people from other schools to participate as well. So if you have friends from other schools, please help spread the word! (Teams can also be formed from members across different schools, so that's a plus if you don't have any friends at SJAM but friends from other schools.)
- Different from the past, the contest will run for an entire month (probably Dec. 21 to Jan. 17)
- Different from the past, there will be twelve problems that apply to any age group (so Gr. 9/10 people will get the same problems as Gr. 11/12); however, there will still be awards for each age group (e.g. Senior Level Gold/Silver/Bronze; Junior Level Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Different from the past, anyone can now participate regardless of their age! There will now be four age divisions (&gt;Gr. 12, Gr. 11/12, Gr. 9/10, &lt;Gr. 9). So please encourage your great-grandparents or your nephews/nieces to participate as well!
- Different from the past, you may now c̶h̶e̶a̶t̶ use online resources for the contest. That's a plus if you can't do addition/subtraction or if you can't memorize the Pythagorean theorem by heart.
