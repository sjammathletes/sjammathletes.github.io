tl;dr: Second SJAM Mathematics Olympiad will be running starting next week and lasting for a month. Students participate in teams of up to 3 and submissions are electronic through our website (<ins style="color:blue;">[https://sjammathletes.github.io/](https://sjammathletes.github.io/)</ins>) which will soon be updated with more information and the problems posted.

Hey Mathletes!

Because of the current state of the world, we'll all be stuck at home so Winter Break will be very boring... or, will it? \*vsauce music intensifies\*

Let SJAM Mathletes announce that we will be organizing the Second SJAM Mathematics Olympiad (SJAMMO2)! It will run from the first week of Winter Break to the end of the 2nd week after Winter Break so that people ~~can be tortured by math~~ have something to enjoy during Winter Break!

For those of you who don't know, we started organizing the SJAMMO in school year 2018-2019 to provide SJAM students an opportunity to experience solving fun math challenges with emotional support from teammates/friends and snacks. And also to make history by giving winners Twice the Deal pizzas as awards.

Unfortunately, 2020 is a special year, and we had to cancel the in-person SJAMMO2 for the school year 2019-2020. However, after ~~procrastinating~~ dedicated hard work by us Mathletes execs, we are now finally ready to present SJAMMO2 in an online format!

More detailed information will come soon. Meanwhile, here is some basic information:
- All information (rules, instructions, awards) and registration/submission will be through our ~~extremely outdated~~ website (<ins style="color:blue;">[https://sjammathletes.github.io/](https://sjammathletes.github.io/)</ins>)
- As in the past, students will participate in teams of up to 3.
- Different from the past, we're accepting people from other schools to participate as well. So if you have friends from other schools, please help spread the word! (Teams can also be formed from members across different schools, so that's a plus if you don't have any friends at SJAM but friends from other schools.)
- Different from the past, the contest will run for an entire month (probably Dec. 21 to Jan. 17)
- Different from the past, there will be twelve problems that apply to any age group (so Gr. 9/10 people will get the same problems as Gr. 11/12); however, there will still be awards for each age group (e.g. Senior Level Gold/Silver/Bronze; Junior Level Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Different from the past, anyone can now participate regardless of their age! There will now be four age divisions (&gt;Gr. 12, Gr. 11/12, Gr. 9/10, &lt;Gr. 9). So please encourage your great-grandparents or your nephews/nieces to participate as well!
- Different from the past, you may now ~~cheat~~ use online resources for the contest. That's a plus if you can't do addition/subtraction or if you can't memorize the Pythagorean theorem by heart.

Hi everyone! Welcome to Mathletes 2020-2021!

Obviously, our club is going to look very different than usual this year. Although we cannot come together to do math in person, we still hope to make Mathletes meaningful even if it is only online. Here is our current plan for the 2020-2021 school year:

1. We will be posting weekly problem sets every Friday at 2:40 pm.
2. Each problem set will consist of 5 multiple choice questions and 3 word problems.
3. In order to track attendance for club credit, each problem set must be submitted within a week of being posted.
4. Your solutions do not have to be correct or fully complete. As long as we can see that you spent time and effort on the problems, you will be rewarded.
5. An answer key will be posted after each problem set is due. If you would like, our execs are also offering to give personal feedback on your solutions.

Our first problem set will be released this Friday. Please note that our plan is not fixed; we will let you know of any changes if they occur. But for now, stay safe, have fun, and keep doing math!

Sincerely,
The 2020-2021 Mathletes Executive Team
